                        <p>Professionally, I started working at Crumbl Cookies in December 2021 and stayed through June 2022. Since it was a new store, I had the opportunity to learn every role and become part of building a strong team culture from the ground up. I helped train new employees, maintained a clean and safe work environment, and made sure customers had a great experience. It taught me how to work efficiently in a fast-paced setting and communicate clearly with both coworkers and guests.

                            </p> <p>From July 2022 through July 2024, I served as a full-time missionary, where I developed leadership, public speaking, and teaching skills. I facilitated district councils, mentored new missionaries, and connected with up to 25 new individuals each week. I later served as a zone and district leader from June to October 2023 and again from February to June 2024. In those roles, I worked closely with mission leadership to plan, lead trainings, and help drive a 1600% increase in baptisms by focusing on intentional outreach and consistent follow-up. I also compiled reports and helped mentor new zone leaders.
                            
                            </p> <p>Giving back has always been important to me. Since 2020, I’ve volunteered over 50 hours at local food banks. Between 2021 and 2024, I also dedicated over 100 hours to various service projects—helping families with moves, organizing a charity run to support individuals with multiple sclerosis, and leading a community landscaping project. These experiences have helped me stay grounded and reminded me how meaningful it is to serve and support others.
